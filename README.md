# Playstation-project

I have recently completed an accelerated apprenticeship with Lightbulb.  One of the projects that was given to us was to create a webpage for Playstation which promoted there VR headset.  The brief also asked that we kept the brands colour scheme and site layout in mind.  

This was my first attempt at frontend development. I was impressed with the final product. It is very frustating not being able to repoduce what I can visualise in my mind because i'm restricted by my technically abilities.  I know with more practice, alot more practice this wont always be the challenge.
